            "description": "A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, sends radiation through the body. However, unlike a simple X-ray study, it offers a much higher level of detail, creating computerized, 360-degree views of the body's structures. CT scans are fast and detailed. They take longer than X-rays but are still fast (about one minute).A CT scan or computed tomography scan is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to get detailed images of the body noninvasively for diagnostic purposes. The personnel that perform CT scans are called radiographers or radiology technologists.",

Mendel studied trait inheritance, patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance. This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.",
