            "description": "A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, sends radiation through the body. However, unlike a simple X-ray study, it offers a much higher level of detail, creating computerized, 360-degree views of the body's structures. CT scans are fast and detailed. They take longer than X-rays but are still fast (about one minute).A CT scan or computed tomography scan is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to get detailed images of the body noninvasively for diagnostic purposes. The personnel that perform CT scans are called radiographers or radiology technologists.",
